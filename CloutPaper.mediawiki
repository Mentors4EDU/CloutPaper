== Abstract ==
CloutPool and CloutLock are decentralized P2P and software defined networking layers that are built to be expansions of the BitClout ecosystem. The premise of CloutPool and CloutLock as projects, is to work as a technological layer that expand pre-existing features that BitClout utilize. Some of these features can include: mining, node hosting, hardware wallets, point of sale systems, e-estores and many more. The focus is on technological infrastructure centered around software defined networking and P2P blockchain capabilities. This paper will talk about many of the technological integrations that CloutPool has in place, and will introduce CloutLock as an expansion of CloutPool through its hardware integratons.

== Purpose ==
Technologies like CloutPool and CloutLock will not just have the ability to make BitClout more decentralized, but will provide different usecases for how blockchains outweigh centralized databases. A reason this paper was created was not only to propose expansions on the BitClout ecosystem, but also due to the fact that lots of these expansions are possible with many underlining technologies the author or his blockchain startups have created. Therefore, it is of the best interest of the author and perpaps the rest of the BitClout community that concepts like these are developed further.

== Introduction ==
BitClout is an up and coming social network built off of the concept of decentralizing social media. It is quite experimental in nature and the premise has been met with both support and backlash. In regards to BitClout, this paper proposes creating another layer untop of BitClout or a BitClout 2.0 if you will. This layer is a hardware and software defined networking system that should be able to expand the capabilities of BitClout through a cryptographic and usecase perspective. It also aims to make BitClout more privacy-focused in regards to cryptography, censorship-resistant and decentralized. This paper introduces two projects known as CloutPool and CloutLock, and its proposed expansions upon BitClout nodes.

Part of the reason BitClout has been met with controversy, has largely been how the network started. The idea of some accounts being pre-reserved for celebrities or large creators and brands without their consent, was considered a growth hack. More then likely this issue can be tackled in the future with integrations of staking for those who have invested their said amount (if they decide to still utilize this concept), or the profiles can simply just be removed as a code commit. Likely, there may need to be some sort of soft fork in order for this commit to rally across nodes. For sake of simplicity, this is something being overlooked in regards to the development of this paper. However, it is important to point out that this technological usecase for kickstarting the network's popularity, obviously wasn't privacy-preserving.

The main concern this paper will focus on is pushing privacy-focused concepts in regards to security, how data is stored, and interconnected peers and data over centralized databases. If BitClout wants to survive in the future, it likely needs to integrate a degree of higher transparency. It also needs to be against any forms of survellience capitalism if it truly wants to fullfil the role of a decentralized social network.

CloutPool wants to be broken into two parts: mining and distributed nodes. For cryptomining, CloutPool wants to target the mining pools and mining farms. This involves both pool hosting and the release of open source mining software. The mining software involved would likely be in the categories of regular mining integrations (pools and protoocols) and open source software for enterprises such as mining farm management software. However, what is more important then these integrations are the distributed node architecture and node hosting. Through a hardware perspective, this is where CloutLock comes into play. 

The CloutLock project which isn't only a project for the basis of open-source hardware wallets, also works on mobile node syndication. This may not seem like a big thing, but when taking into account running nodes on P2P stores, the potential of Crypto ATMs, Point of Sale systems, etc., CloutLock can bridge the gap between BitClout and many disruptive business models. Most of these business models are centered around mass adoption beyond just a social networking app. It is also important to note that the author utilizes lots of the same concepts in the blockchain architecture of his own projects and crypto projects he has worked on. This is because these models bring about the usecases that a blockchain is truly about. 

=== Mining ===
As of the writing of this paper, BitClout is yet to release its mining compatibility. Once it is released, it is of the author's opinion that it would likely be something close to Blake2b or utilize some variation of the BLAKE hash functions. CloutPool aims to go beyond just hosting a mining pool, but also release mining pool software and different protocols as an extension to BitClout's chosen algorithm. This may include virtual machines with mining pre-configured in it or variations of multi-cloud infrastructures to support large scale mining farms.

=== P2P Stores ===
A simple technological implementation for further expanding BitClout's ecosystem can be P2P stores. This can be done with something as simple as an OpenBazaar fork, and later become more complex like a p2shop module of interconnected P2P shopping carts w/ the decentralized-internet SDK. Something like that would utilize grid computing and offline data syncing capabilities. In regards to P2P stores, is the ability to not just sell things in a privacy-preserving setting, but also redifine the shopping experience. You can configure local places where you might pickup an online order such as drive-through centers within peers. There is an ability to do this in a privacy-preserving way such as adding peers to your "local network" that you might transact with.

==== Ghost Kitchens ====
Another concept or technological implementation could be the introduction of virtual restaurant and open franchise type concepts. The virtual restaurant concept have been around for a while, and so has the OpenFranchise model which is different. Applications like BitClout and different technological integrations, can allow for a P2P point of sale system that offers a more decentralized variation of the traditional food delivery model. The ability to launch virtual restaurant brands already exists, but taking it a step further with no centralized database and cutting out the middleman for the virtual brands can make this even more open.

=== Crypto ATMS ===
Crypto ATMs are another technological implementation that can either expand BitClout's ecosystem or even be utilized as part of a node distribution system. The simplest crypto ATM can be a fork of OpenBitcoinATM or other similar projects. One thing to take into account is that likely in the beginning, this would be for demonstration purposes only. This is in part due to need of money transmitting licenses and regulatory aspects. However, over time as more regulational hurdles are worked through, more and more people may be in the capacity to build pre-configured crypto ATM systems.

=== BLE Payments ===
A project to take into consideration, is the utilization of a potential privacy-focused BLE and NFC gateway for BitClout or creator coins like CloutLock. Firstly, it is important to note that this is something also considered experimental. In regards to the technological implementation, likely it would implement something close to the NTAG215 or other similar systems. The idea is simple, create cards that implement your seed phase. Then run nodes that call in BitClout's identity API for specific functions that enable you to pay in or transfer BitClout. It would need to be done in a privacy-preserving way that doesn't enable tracking and doesn't store your private information in its systems. Likely this can be done with an application interface that works as some sort of authenticator with what you are trying to purchase. 

=== Soft Fork Proposal ===
Once the code is likely audited and released, comes the possibility of expanding BitClout's ecosystem with direct soft forks to the blockchain. A potential soft fork that the author of this paper has thought of, is the integration of offline browsing compatibility or P2P data transfers for nodes. This goes beyond the BlueGUI protocol or interconnected bluetooth devices for data transferring. Infact, this soft fork proposal actually integrates the decentralized-internet SDK. The idea is simple. Firstly, the NGINX servers will be upgraded to

=== Node Syndication Services ===
Outside of mining, CloutPool also aims to introduce various node syndication services and hosting services. This can be done both through software offerings and actual hosting services as well. The software will be

=== Open Source Hardware Wallets ===
The main capabilites of CloutLock revolves around various open source hardware wallets and different levels of hardware integrations or compatibilities. Some examples include
