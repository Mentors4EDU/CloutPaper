== Abstract ==
CloutPool and CloutLock are decentralized P2P and software defined networking layers that are built to be expansions of the BitClout ecosystem. The premise of CloutPool and CloutLock as projects,

== Purpose ==

== Introduction ==
BitClout is an up and coming social network built off of the concept of decentralizing social media. It is quite experimental in nature and the premise has been met with both support and backlash. In regards to BitClout, this paper proposes creating another layer untop of BitClout or a BitClout 2.0 if you will. This layer is a hardware and software defined networking system that should be able to expand the capabilities of BitClout through a cryptographic and usecase perspective. It also aims to make BitClout more privacy-focused in regards to cryptography, censorship-resistant and decentralized. This paper introduces two projects known as CloutPool and CloutLock, and its proposed expansions upon BitClout nodes.

Part of the reason BitClout has been met with controversy, has largely been how the network started.

CloutPool wants to be broken into two parts: mining and distributed nodes. For cryptomining, CloutPool wants to target the mining pools and mining farms. This involves both pool hosting and the release of open source mining software. The mining software involved would likely be

=== Mining ===
As of the writing of this paper, BitClout is yet to release its mining compatibility. Once it is released, it is of the author's opinion that it would likely be something close to Blake2b or utilize some variation of the BLAKE hash functions.

=== P2P Stores ===
A simple technological implementation for further expanding BitClout's ecosystem can be P2P stores. This can be done with something as simple as an OpenBazaar fork, and later become more complex like a p2shop module of interconnected P2P shopping carts w/ the decentralized-internet SDK. Something like that would utilize grid computing and offline data syncing capabilities. In regards to P2P stores, 

=== Crypto ATMS ===
Crypto ATMs are another technological implementation that can either expand BitClout's ecosystem or even be utilized as part of a node distribution system. The simplest crypto ATM can be a fork of OpenBitcoinATM or other similar projects. One thing to take into account is, likely in the beginning this would be for demonstration purposes only. This is in part due to
