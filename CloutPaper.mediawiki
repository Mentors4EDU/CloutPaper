== Abstract ==
CloutPool and CloutLock are decentralized P2P and software defined networking layers that are built to be expansions of the BitClout ecosystem. The premise of CloutPool and CloutLock as projects, is to work as a technological layer that expand pre-existing features that BitClout utilize. Some of these features can include: mining, node hosting, hardware wallets, point of sale systems, e-estores and many more. The focus is on technological infrastructure centered around software defined networking and P2P blockchain capabilities. This paper will talk about many of the technological integrations that CloutPool has in place, and will introduce CloutLock as an expansion of CloutPool through its hardware integratons.

== Purpose ==
Technologies like CloutPool and CloutLock will

== Introduction ==
BitClout is an up and coming social network built off of the concept of decentralizing social media. It is quite experimental in nature and the premise has been met with both support and backlash. In regards to BitClout, this paper proposes creating another layer untop of BitClout or a BitClout 2.0 if you will. This layer is a hardware and software defined networking system that should be able to expand the capabilities of BitClout through a cryptographic and usecase perspective. It also aims to make BitClout more privacy-focused in regards to cryptography, censorship-resistant and decentralized. This paper introduces two projects known as CloutPool and CloutLock, and its proposed expansions upon BitClout nodes.

Part of the reason BitClout has been met with controversy, has largely been how the network started.

CloutPool wants to be broken into two parts: mining and distributed nodes. For cryptomining, CloutPool wants to target the mining pools and mining farms. This involves both pool hosting and the release of open source mining software. The mining software involved would likely be

=== Mining ===
As of the writing of this paper, BitClout is yet to release its mining compatibility. Once it is released, it is of the author's opinion that it would likely be something close to Blake2b or utilize some variation of the BLAKE hash functions.

=== P2P Stores ===
A simple technological implementation for further expanding BitClout's ecosystem can be P2P stores. This can be done with something as simple as an OpenBazaar fork, and later become more complex like a p2shop module of interconnected P2P shopping carts w/ the decentralized-internet SDK. Something like that would utilize grid computing and offline data syncing capabilities. In regards to P2P stores, 

=== Crypto ATMS ===
Crypto ATMs are another technological implementation that can either expand BitClout's ecosystem or even be utilized as part of a node distribution system. The simplest crypto ATM can be a fork of OpenBitcoinATM or other similar projects. One thing to take into account is, likely in the beginning this would be for demonstration purposes only. This is in part due to 

=== BLE Payments ===
A project to take into consideration, is the utilization of a potential privacy-focused BLE and NFC gateway for BitClout or creator coins like CloutLock. Firstly, it is important to note that this is something also considered experimental. In regards to the technological implementation, 

=== Soft Fork Proposal ===
Once the code is likely audited and released, comes the possibility of expanding BitClout's ecosystem with direct soft forks to the blockchain. A potential soft fork that the author of this paper has thought of, is the integration of offline browsing compatibility or P2P data transfers for nodes. This goes beyond the BlueGUI protocol or interconnected bluetooth devices for data transferring. Infact, this soft fork proposal actually integrates the decentralized-internet SDK. The idea is simple. Firstly, the NGINX servers will be upgraded to

=== Node Syndication Services ===
Outside of mining, CloutPool also aims to introduce various node syndication services and hosting services. This can be done both through software offerings and actual hosting services as well. The software will be

=== Open Source Hardware Wallets ===
The main capabilites of CloutLock revolves around various open source hardware wallets and different levels of hardware integrations or compatibilities. Some examples include

== Impact ==
Eventually, all these technological integrations can create a full-scale decentralized ecosystem. Technologies such as 

== Key Milestones ==
There are a series of key milestones to take into account regarding this paper and its proposals. Milestones such as 

=== Milestone #1 ===
The first milestones are centered around the rather simple technological integrations and what has been done so far.

=== Milestone #2 ===
The second series of milestones are centered around how many of the technological integrations being developed will further expand.

=== Future Milestones ===
There are many milestones in regards to how CloutPool and its technologies will expand and further phase developments.

== Cryptographic Mechanisms ==
There are a series of technologies that implement certain cryptographic mechanisms that may be compatible with BitClout. Some 

=== Lock Mechanisms ===
Lock mechanisms compatible with BitClout include

=== Storing Seed Phases ===
Technologies like what CloutLock provide will
